# Covid-19

In this project I will be using Python to download Covid-19 data from the following website https://covid19.who.int/data. The website contains data provided by WHO about the official daily counts of COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccine utilisation reported by each country. 

The 4 CSVs that may be downloaded are:

**1. Daily cases and deaths reported to WHO** - https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv  
**2. Latest reported counts of cases and deaths** - https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-table-data.csv  
**3. Vaccination data** - https://covid19.who.int/who-data/vaccination-data.csv  
**4. Vaccination metadata** - https://covid19.who.int/who-data/vaccination-metadata.csv  

A description of the fields may be found under the data download section at https://covid19.who.int/data.

I have used Tableau Public to create data visualisations based on these datasets. These may be viewed at the following links:

**COVID-19 Vaccination data**  

https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vincent5105/viz/Covid-19_16617863060290/VaccinationDashboard  

This dashboard allows you to select the top X number of countries based on the number of people fully vaccinated. A breakdown of all the types of vaccines used for the countries selected is displayed as well as heatmaps with detailed information about the number of people with at least one vaccine dose, fully vaccinated or with booster vaccines. Individual countries may be selected if they are present on the top countries list to display country specific information about vaccines.
